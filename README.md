# book-hotel-project

Hi! Hello Everyone!!!
This is my Booking Hotel Website. This is a group project I've done in 2nd Semester of my Uni.
I work on some but not this entire project.

If you want to see the prototype, you can copy this link below:

What I do in this Collaboration:

- Design
- Prototype
- HTML (I forgot what page, but I think me and my friend work on splash, login, register, main page, and contact us page)
- CSS
- JavaScript
